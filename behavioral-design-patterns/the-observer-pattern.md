# The Observer Pattern

## Intent

_A short statement that answers the following questions:_

* _What does the design pattern do?_
* _What is its rationale and intent?_
* _What particular design issue or problem does it address?_

## Also Known As

_Other well-known names for the pattern, if any._

## Motivation

_A scenario that illustrates a design problem and how the class and object structures in the pattern solve the problem.  
The scenario will help you understand the more abstract description of the pattern that follows._

## Applicability

* _What are the situations in which the design pattern can be applied?_
* _What are examples of poor designs that the pattern can address?_
* _How can you recognise these situations?_

## Structure

_A graphical representation of the classes in the pattern using a notation based on the Unified Modeling Language \(UML\).  
We also use interaction diagrams to illustrate sequences of requests and collaborations between objects._

_You can use ArgoUML as a free software to create UML class diagrams \(_[_http://argouml.tigris.org/\_](http://argouml.tigris.org/%29\)_ or give a look at this list _[_https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Unified\_Modeling\_Language\_tools_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unified_Modeling_Language_tools)

## Participants

_The classes and/or objects participating in the design pattern and their responsibilities._

## Collaborations

_How the participants collaborate to carry out their responsibilities._

## Consequences \(aka Pros and Cons\)

* _How does the pattern support its objectives?_
* _What are the trade-offs and results of using the pattern?_
* _What aspect of system structure does it let you vary independently?_

## Implementation

* _What pitfalls, hints, or techniques should you be aware of when implementing the pattern?_
* _Are there language-specific issues?_

## Sample Code

_Code fragments that illustrate how you might implement the pattern in JavaScript or Java.  
\(Make yourself sure to have GitHub repo which hosts real working examples. So list the link to repo here\)_

## Known Uses

_Examples of the pattern found in real systems.  
We include at least two examples from different domains._
